We have used sql servers since thanks to them we can store incidents more easily and have better access to them to offer a solution.

In addition to this we have used figma to create all the pages and the mobile version of them.

We use jira app to help develop de user flow and the time used to create all.

Also we use Visual Studio Code to implement the code used on all the pages and the buttons used by the people to implement their incidents and modify them.

we also use Vue, SCSS, JAVA and css framwork.
